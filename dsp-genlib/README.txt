This folder originates from https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF-Max-Gen/tree/master/plugins/common/gen_dsp
It is a gen~ dsp folder generated using Cycling '74 Max gen~ code exporter using Max 7.2.
The version is important, as the license changed in 7.3 to no longer be under BSD3/ISC/MIT-style permissible license but under a new commercial license which is not considered open-source.

Modifications were made so that it no longer depends on DPF for building.
